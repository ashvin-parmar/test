Here we are learning about how we can restore data that by mistake deleted from repository.


There are many cases occurred in which data lost and commit are created which leads to loose data and we forget to recover that data. and at some point we remember that those data are our necessity and we need those data but those are available in previous commits.

There are a case in which commit is goes into stash area by chance, I have put data in stash area and then recover those data using commit ID's. 

Here we are starting video...

HERE WE DONE SOME CHANGES....


By Mistake we are put our data to unstaged area by using git rm --staged

No Changes are shown here, and show that all staged area content are comes here in new commit

PROBLEM: There are some of data that are stored in previous commits are not show here.

Here we are solving this problem...
