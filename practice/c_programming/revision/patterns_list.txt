### Patterns 
pattern1:  Addition perform with incrementing fashion from 1 [eg5.c]
pattern2: Multiplication perform with increment fashion  -> Factorial Series [eg6.c]
pattern3: Fibonacci pattern [eg7.c] 
pattern4: Random pattern [+1,-2,+3,-4,+5,-6] [eg8.c]

//Not Pattern
eg9.c -> Finding prime number from a range.
eg10.c -> digit count in integer
eg11.c -> travers on integer from backward
eg12.c -> traversal on interger from forward direction
eg13.c -> Find power of base^exp
eg14.c -> Find armstrong number in a range

//Patterns Again
eg15.c -> Linear sort, Selection sort pattern
eg16.c -> Bubble Sort
eg17.c -> Some pattern
eg18.c -> forward-backward comparison
eg19.c -> simple pattern (1-5)
eg20.c -> stars pyramid
