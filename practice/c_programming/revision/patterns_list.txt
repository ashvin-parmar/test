### Patterns 
pattern1:  Addition perform with incrementing fashion from 1 [eg5.c]
pattern2: Multiplication perform with increment fashion  -> Factorial Series [eg6.c]
pattern3: Fibonacci pattern [eg7.c] 
pattern4: Random pattern [+1,-2,+3,-4,+5,-6] [eg8.c]

eg9.c -> Finding prime number from a range.
eg10.c -> digit count in integer
eg11.c -> travers on integer from backward
eg12.c -> traversal on interger from forward direction
eg13.c -> Find power of base^exp
eg14.c -> Find armstrong number in a range
