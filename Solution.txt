Here is the solution

I am gonna using 5 common commands to restore any type of data


1) git log -all			: To see all type of commits whatever they are using --amend or using any type of commits like... (refs/stash)

2) git checkout 'Commit-ID's' 	: To get teleport at the place of that commit data, Those data are not available using gihub
				: Those data are only accessed using git 
3) git switch -			: to get out of that situation


3-1) git switch -c 'branch-name' 	: To get easily access of all data using a branch or add those deleted data 
					: directly from that branch to master branch
